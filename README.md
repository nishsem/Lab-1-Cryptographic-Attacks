üìä Network Protocol Vulnerability Lab

Overview

This project is a lab-based security assessment of common network protocols (FTP, TELNET, SSH, HTTP) focused on identifying vulnerabilities through brute force attacks and analyzing network traffic. The goal is to demonstrate protocol weaknesses and recommend secure alternatives.

üí° Objectives

Enumerate network services and discover usernames.

Perform brute force attacks using tools like Hydra and Burp Suite.

Sniff network traffic to detect plaintext vs. encrypted data.

Analyze weaknesses in each protocol.

Propose mitigation strategies and secure alternatives.

‚öñÔ∏è Tools Used

nmap - Network scanning

Hydra - Brute force tool

Medusa - Brute force alternative

Burp Suite - HTTP login brute forcing

Wireshark / tcpdump - Network packet analysis

enum4linux / NetExec - Username enumeration

üí° Lab Tasks Summary

1. Service Enumeration

Scanned target VM for open ports: FTP (21), SSH (22), TELNET (23), HTTP (80).

Discovered usernames via enum4linux and manual login attempts.

2. Brute Force Attacks

Used Hydra to brute force FTP, TELNET, and SSH.

Used Burp Suite Intruder to brute force an HTTP login form.

Identified weak credentials and gained access.

3. Packet Sniffing

Captured login sessions with Wireshark.

Verified that FTP, TELNET, and HTTP transmit data in plaintext.

Confirmed that SSH encrypts all data.

4. Issues and Resolutions

Rate limiting was encountered; resolved using delays.

Burp Community Edition has limitations; adapted strategy accordingly.

5. Mitigation Strategies
Protocol | Vulnerability       | Secure Alternative
FTP      | Plaintext login     | SFTP / FTPS
TELNET   | No encryption       | SSH
HTTP     | Exposes credentials | HTTPS
SSH      | Brute force risk    | Use Fail2Ban, key-based auth
